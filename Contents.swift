// KVO - Key-value observing

// KVO is part of the observer pattern
// NotifiactionCenter is also an observer pattern
// NotificationCenter.postNotification(name: "API Observer")

// KVO ia a one-to many pattern relationship as opposed to delegation, which is a one-to-one

// In the delegation pattern
// class ViewController: UIViewController {}
// e.g. tableView.dataSource = self

// KVO is an Objective-C runtime API
// Along with KVO being an objective-c runtime some essentials are required
// 1. The object being observed needs to be a class
// 2. The class needs to inherit from NSObject, NSObject is the top abstarct class in Objective-C. The class also needs to be marked @objc
// 3. Any property being marked for observation needs to be prefixed with @objc dynamic. dynamic means that the property is being dynamically dispatched (at runtime the compiler verifies the underlying property)
// In swift types are statically dispatched which means they are checked at compile time vs Objective-C which is dynamiclly dispatched and checked at runtime

// Static vs dynamic dispatch

// Dog class (class being observed) - will have a property to be observed
